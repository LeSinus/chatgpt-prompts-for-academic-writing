# chatgpt-prompts-for-academic-writing
This compilation of writing prompts encompasses a variety of topics and tasks, which include brainstorming research ideas, refining language and style, performing literature reviews, and formulating research plans.

> **TIP#1:** ChatGPT has a query size limit—the maximum amount of text that it can handle at once. The limit is 4096 tokens.
A token is a chunk of language that ChatGPT treats as a separate item. Depending on the language, this can be anything from a single character to a whole word. So the maximum length of a query is between 4096 characters and 4096 words (2-12 pages).
You can input your text multiple times using the prompt "Read this [PARAPGRAPH]:" and then run your final prompt "Considering the above text...".

> **TIP#2:** If you need to create a new line, press Shift+Enter. (Don’t press Enter on its own because that sends the prompt to  ChatGPT.) If you need to paste in something you’ve copied from elsewhere, give a Paste command. Normally, pressing the standard shortcut, Ctrl+V, is the easiest way. But you can also right-click in the prompt box, and then click Paste on the contextual menu.

> **TIP#3:** ChatGPT isn’t just there to take orders. It can also ask questions.
Before generating the content of a section, you could start with the prompt, “Please ask me all of the questions you need to help me write this PART.” “PART” could also be more specific, like “introduction” or “conclusion.”

> **TIP#4:** To force ChatGPT to continue, you can reply to the chatbot with keywords like “Continue writing”, “Go on”, “Finish answer” or specify the portion of text you want it to continue from.
> If you’re unable to make ChatGPT follow your “continue” queries with the right response, you can enter the following text inside ChatGPT to continue writing from where it left off: From now on when I say "continue" you must revisit the last sample of code you gave. Look at the last line of the code and continue the code from there. Do not start from the beginning of the code.

> **TIP#5:** If you find it annoying to make ChatGPT continue responding, an easier approach to get the job done is to make it split its responses into multiple pages or chapters. You can script your input in a style similar to this:
Create an essay on "Historical perspective on ecological problems" and divide it into 20 different pages. Let's start with Page 1.

> When ChatGPT generates a response for the first page, you can get subsequent responses by typing Page 2, Page 3, and so on.

> **TIP#6:** As a rule of thumb, seek to follow these steps for better prompts:
> 1. Give ChatGPT an identity
> 2. Define your objective
> 3. Add constraints to your prompt
> 4. Give ChatGPT a structure to follow
> 5. Refine the output through conversation
